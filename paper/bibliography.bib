	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dynamics of nuclear organization, nuclear bodies and RNPs in particular has been the focus of many studies. To understand their function, knowledge of their spatial nuclear position and temporal translocation is essential. Typically, such studies generate a wealth of data that require novel methods in image analysis and computational tools to quantitatively track particle movement on the background of moving cells and shape changing nuclei.
RESULTS: We developed a novel 4-D image processing platform (TIKAL) for the work with laser scanning and wide field microscopes. TIKAL provides a registration software for correcting global movements and local deformations of cells as well as 2-D and 3-D tracking software. With this new tool, we studied the dynamics of two different types of nuclear particles, namely nuclear bodies made from GFP-NLS-vimentin and microinjected 0.1 mum - wide polystyrene beads, by live cell time-lapse microscopy combined with single particle tracking and mobility analysis. We now provide a tool for the automatic 3-D analysis of particle movement in parallel with the acquisition of chromatin density data.
CONCLUSIONS: Kinetic analysis revealed 4 modes of movement: confined obstructed, normal diffusion and directed motion. Particle tracking on the background of stained chromatin revealed that particle movement is directly related to local reorganization of chromatin. Further a direct comparison of particle movement in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm exhibited an entirely different kinetic behaviour of vimentin particles in both compartments. The kinetics of nuclear particles were slightly affected by depletion of ATP and significantly disturbed by disruption of actin and microtubule networks. Moreover, the hydration state of the nucleus had a strong impact on the mobility of nuclear bodies since both normal diffusion and directed motion were entirely abolished when cells were challenged with 0.6 M sorbitol. This effect correlated with the compaction of chromatin. We conclude that alteration in chromatin density directly influences the mobility of protein assemblies within the nucleus.},

	Abstract = {Stress granules are cytoplasmic mRNA-silencing foci that form transiently during the stress response. Stress granules harbor abortive translation initiation complexes and are in dynamic equilibrium with translating polysomes. Mammalian Staufen 1 (Stau1) is a ubiquitous double-stranded RNA-binding protein associated with polysomes. Here, we show that Stau1 is recruited to stress granules upon induction of endoplasmic reticulum or oxidative stress as well in stress granules induced by translation initiation blockers. We found that stress granules lacking Stau1 formed in cells depleted of this molecule, indicating that Stau1 is not an essential component of stress granules. Moreover, Stau1 knockdown facilitated stress granule formation upon stress induction. Conversely, transient transfection of Stau1 impaired stress granule formation upon stress or pharmacological initiation arrest. The inhibitory capacity of Stau1 mapped to the amino-terminal half of the molecule, a region known to bind to polysomes. We found that the fraction of polysomes remaining upon stress induction was enriched in Stau1, and that Stau1 overexpression stabilized polysomes against stress. We propose that Stau1 is involved in recovery from stress by stabilizing polysomes, thus helping stress granule dissolution.},

@article{Kedersha:2002kx,
	Abstract = {Mammalian stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic domains into which mRNAs are sorted dynamically in response to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha, a key regulatory step in translational initiation. The activation of one or more of the eIF2alpha kinases leads to SG assembly by decreasing the levels of eIF2-GTP-tRNA(Met), the ternary complex that is normally required for loading the initiator methionine onto the 48 S preinitiation complex to begin translation. This stress-induced scarcity of eIF2-GTP-tRNA(Met) allows the RNA-binding proteins TIA-1 (T-cell internal antigen-1) and TIAR (TIA-1-related protein) to bind the 48 S complex in lieu of the ternary complex, thereby promoting polysome disassembly and the concurrent routing of the mRNA into a SG. The actual formation of SGs occurs upon auto-aggregation of the prion-like C-termini of TIA-1 proteins; this aggregation is reversed in vivo by overexpression of the heat-shock protein (HSP) chaperone HSP70. Remarkably, HSP70 mRNA is excluded from SGs and is preferentially translated during stress, indicating that the RNA composition of the SG is selective. Moreover, the effects of HSP70 on TIA aggregation suggest a feedback loop whereby HSP70 synthesis is auto-regulated. Proteins that promote mRNA stability [e.g. HuR (Hu protein R)] and destabilize mRNA [i.e. tristetraprolin (TTP)] are also recruited to SGs, suggesting that SGs effect a process of mRNA triage, by promoting polysome disassembly and routing mRNAs to cytoplasmic domains enriched for HuR and TTP. This model reveals connections between the eIF2alpha kinase system, mRNA stability and cellular chaperone levels.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of trajectories of dynamical biological objects, such as breeding ants or cell organelles, is essential to reveal the interactions they develop with their environments. Many previous works used a global characterization based on parameters calculated for entire trajectories. In cases where transient behavior was detected, this usually concerned only a particular type, such as confinement or directed motion. However, these approaches are not appropriate in situations in which the tracked objects may display many different types of transient motion. We have developed a method to exhaustively analyze different kinds of transient behavior that the tracked objects may exhibit. The method discriminates stalled periods, constrained and directed motions from random dynamics by evaluating the diffusion coefficient, the mean-square displacement curvature, and the trajectory asymmetry along individual trajectories. To detect transient motions of various durations, these parameters are calculated along trajectories using a rolling analysis window whose width is variable. The method was applied to the study of secretory vesicle dynamics in the subplasmalemmal region of human carcinoid BON cells. Analysis of transitions between transient motion periods, combined with plausible assumptions about the origin of each motion type, leads to a model of dynamical subplasmalemmal organization.},

	Abstract = {In this review recent data describing stress granules are summarized. Stress granules are specific RNA-containing structures in the cytoplasm of living cells which arise under stress conditions (e. g. heat shock, UV irradiation, energy depletion and oxidative stress). It became evident that stress granules accumulate non-canonical 48S initiation complexes and contain mRNA with associated proteins, small ribosomal subunits and some initiation factors. Stress granules are depleted with ternary complex and large ribosomal subunit. It's proposed that eIF2alpha phosphorylation and ternary complex decrease can be a trigger for stress granule formation. Shuttling nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein TIA-1 plays a crucial role in this process. It's proposed that TIA-1 forms prion-like aggregates, and these aggregates are scaffolds for other components of stress granules. Cytoskeletal structures facilitate the accumulation of stress granule components in local cytoplasmic sites. Investigation of process of stress granule formation is important for understanding of cell reaction to stress and translation regulation mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Mammalian stress granules (SGs) harbor untranslated mRNAs that accumulate in cells exposed to environmental stress. Drugs that stabilize polysomes (emetine) inhibit the assembly of SGs, whereas drugs that destabilize polysomes (puromycin) promote the assembly of SGs. Moreover, emetine dissolves preformed SGs as it promotes the assembly of polysomes, suggesting that these mRNP species (i.e., SGs and polysomes) exist in equilibrium. We used green flourescent protein-tagged SG-associated RNA-binding proteins (specifically, TIA-1 and poly[A] binding protein [PABP-I]) to monitor SG assembly, disassembly, and turnover in live cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching shows that both TIA-1 and PABP-I rapidly and continuously shuttle in and out of SGs, indicating that the assembly of SGs is a highly dynamic process. This unexpected result leads us to propose that mammalian SGs are sites at which untranslated mRNAs are sorted and processed for either reinitiation, degradation, or packaging into stable nonpolysomal mRNP complexes. A truncation mutant of TIA-1 (TIA-1DeltaRRM), which acts as a transdominant inhibitor of SG assembly, promotes the expression of cotransfected reporter genes in COS transfectants, suggesting that this process of mRNA triage might, directly or indirectly, influence protein expression.},

	Abstract = {Cytoplasmic RNA structures such as stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) are functional byproducts of mRNA metabolism, sharing substrate mRNA, dynamic properties and many proteins, but also housing separate components and performing independent functions. Each can exist independently, but when coordinately induced they are often tethered together in a cytosolic dance. Although both self-assemble in response to stress-induced perturbations in translation, several recent reports reveal novel proteins and RNAs that are components of these structures but also perform other cellular functions. Proteins that mediate splicing, transcription, adhesion, signaling and development are all integrated with SG and PB assembly. Thus, these ephemeral bodies represent more than just the dynamic sorting of mRNA between translation and decay.},

	Abstract = {Environmental stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha inhibits protein translation by reducing the availability of eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)Met, the ternary complex that joins initiator tRNA(Met) to the 43S preinitiation complex. The resulting untranslated mRNA is dynamically routed to discrete cytoplasmic foci known as stress granules (SGs), a process requiring the related RNA-binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR. SGs appear to be in equilibrium with polysomes, but the nature of this relationship is obscure. We now show that most components of the 48S preinitiation complex (i.e., small, but not large, ribosomal subunits, eIF3, eIF4E, eIF4G) are coordinately recruited to SGs in arsenite-stressed cells. In contrast, eIF2 is not a component of newly assembled SGs. Cells expressing a phosphomimetic mutant (S51D) of eIF2alpha assemble SGs of similar composition, confirming that the recruitment of these factors is a direct consequence of blocked translational initiation and not due to other effects of arsenite. Surprisingly, phospho-eIF2alpha is recruited to SGs that are disassembling in cells recovering from arsenite-induced stress. We discuss these results in the context of a translational checkpoint model wherein TIA and eIF2 are functional antagonists of translational initiation, and in which lack of ternary complex drives SG assembly.},

	Abstract = {Structural proteins of the membrane skeleton are thought to form "corrals" at the membrane surface, and these corrals may restrict lateral diffusion of membrane proteins. Recent experimental developments in single-particle tracking and laser trapping make it possible to examine the corral model in detail. Techniques to interpret these experiments are presented. First, escape times for a diffusing particle in a corral are obtained from Monte Carlo calculations and analytical solutions for various corral sizes, shapes, and escape probabilities, and reduced to a common curve. Second, the identification of corrals in tracking experiments is considered. The simplest way to identify corrals is by sight. If the walls are impermeable enough, a trajectory fills the corral before the diffusing particle escapes. The fraction of distinct sites visited before escape is calculated for corrals of various sizes, shapes, and escape probabilities, and reduced to a common curve. This fraction is also a measure of the probability that the diffusing species will react with another species in the corral before escaping. Finally, the effect of the sampling interval on the measurement of the short-range diffusion coefficient is examined.},

	Abstract = {The movements of intracellular cargo along microtubules within cells are often saltatory or of short duration. Further, calculations of the fraction of membrane vesicles that are moving at any period, indicate that active motor complexes are rare. From observations of normal vesicle traffic in cells, there appears to be position-dependent activation of motors and a balance of traffic in the inward and outward directions. In-vitro binding of motors to cargo is observed under many conditions but motility is not. Multi-component complexes appear to be involved in producing active organelle movements by a graded activation system that is highly localized in the cell. The basis of the activation of motility of the organelle motor complexes is still unknown but phosphorylation has been implicated in many systems. In the case of the motor-binding protein, kinectin, it has been linked to active organelle movements powered by conventional kinesin. From the coiled-coil structure of kinectin and the coiled-coil tail of kinesin, it is postulated that a coiled-coil assembly is responsible for the binding interaction. Many other cargoes are transported but the control of transport will be customized for each function, such as axonemal rafts or cytoskeletal complexes. Each function will have to be analyzed separately and motor activity will need to be integrated into the specific aspects of the function.},

	Abstract = {Exit sites (ES) are specialized domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at which cargo proteins of the secretory pathway are packaged into COPII-coated vesicles. Although the essential COPII proteins (Sar1p, Sec23p-Sec24p, Sec13p-Sec31p) have been characterized in detail and their sequential binding kinetics at ER membranes have been quantified, the basic processes that govern the self-assembly and spatial organization of ERES have remained elusive. Here, we have formulated a generic computational model that describes the process of formation of ERES on a mesoscopic scale. The model predicts that ERES are arranged in a quasi-crystalline pattern, while their size strongly depends on the cargo-modulated kinetics of COPII turnover - that is, a lack of cargo leads to smaller and more mobile ERES. These predictions are in favorable agreement with experimental data obtained by fluorescence microscopy. The model further suggests that cooperative binding of COPII components, for example mediated by regulatory proteins, is a key factor for the experimentally observed organism-specific ERES pattern. Moreover, the anterograde secretory flux is predicted to grow when the average size of ERES is increased, whereas an increase in the number of (small) ERES only slightly alters the flux.},

To interpret observed trajectories correctly, one must consider not only the trajectories themselves but also the probabilities of occurrence of various trajectories.

	Abstract = {Stress granules (SGs) are ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-containing assemblies that are formed in the cytoplasm in response to stress. Previously, we demonstrated that microtubule depolymerization inhibited SG formation. Here, we show that arsenate-induced SGs move throughout the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner, and microtubules are required for SG disassembly, but not for SG persistence. Analysis of SG movement revealed that SGs exhibited obstructed diffusion on an average, though sometimes SGs demonstrated rapid displacements. Microtubule depolymerization did not influence preformed SG number and size, but significantly reduced the average velocity of SG movement, the frequency of quick movement events, and the apparent diffusion coefficient of SGs. Actin filament disruption had no effect on the SG motility. In cycloheximide-treated cells SGs dissociated into constituent parts that then dissolved within the cytoplasm. Microtubule depolymerization inhibited cycloheximide-induced SG disassembly. However, microtubule depolymerization did not influence the dynamics of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) in SGs, according to FRAP results. We suggest that the increase of SG size is facilitated by the transport of smaller SGs along microtubules with subsequent fusion of them. At least some protein components of SGs can exchange with the cytoplasmic pool independently of microtubules.},

@article{Chernov:2009fk,
	Abstract = {Following exposure to various stresses (arsenite, UV, hyperthermia, and hypoxia), mRNAs are assembled into large cytoplasmic bodies known as "stress granules," in which mRNAs and associated proteins may be processed by specific enzymes for different purposes like transient storing, sorting, silencing, or other still unknown processes. To limit mRNA damage during stress, the assembly of micrometric granules has to be rapid, and, indeed, it takes only approximately 10-20 min in living cells. However, such a rapid assembly breaks the rules of hindered diffusion in the cytoplasm, which states that large cytoplasmic bodies are almost immobile. In the present work, using HeLa cells and YB-1 protein as a stress granule marker, we studied three hypotheses to understand how cells overcome the limitation of hindered diffusion: shuttling of small messenger ribonucleoprotein particles from small to large stress granules, sliding of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles along microtubules, microtubule-mediated stirring of large stress granules. Our data favor the two last hypotheses and underline that microtubule dynamic instability favors the formation of micrometric stress granules.},

@article{Kedersha27121999,
	Abstract = {In response to environmental stress, the related RNA-binding proteins TIA-1 and TIAR colocalize with poly(A)+ RNA at cytoplasmic foci that resemble the stress granules (SGs) that harbor untranslated mRNAs in heat shocked plant cells (Nover et al. 1989; Nover et al. 1983; Scharf et al. 1998). The accumulation of untranslated mRNA at SGs is reversible in cells that recover from a sublethal stress, but irreversible in cells subjected to a lethal stress. We have found that the assembly of TIA-1/R+ SGs is initiated by the phosphorylation of eIF-2?. A phosphomimetic eIF-2? mutant (S51D) induces the assembly of SGs, whereas a nonphosphorylatable eIF-2? mutant (S51A) prevents the assembly of SGs. The ability of a TIA-1 mutant lacking its RNA-binding domains to function as a transdominant inhibitor of SG formation suggests that this RNA-binding protein acts downstream of the phosphorylation of eIF-2? to promote the sequestration of untranslated mRNAs at SGs. The assembly and disassembly of SGs could regulate the duration of stress- induced translational arrest in cells recovering from environmental stress.},
